# Software Testing and Quality Assurance Project

## Calculator Logic
This is from a project for my Software Testing and Quality Assurance class at school. For this project I had to create a simple calculator that performs specific operations that my Professor specified, therefore it's not a normal calculator. The Calculator Logic was Written in Java.
## Unit Test
The unit tests were created with Maven and JUnit 5
